            <h2>Customer Feedback</h2>
                <p>"This Dal recipe reminded me of my mom’s cooking back home. Simple ingredients, but the tadka added such depth of flavor. Perfect with hot rice and a bit of ghee. I’ve already made it twice this week!" - Ronak R.</p>
            
                <p>"The Biryani was flavorful and aromatic! Loved how the spices were balanced—not too overpowering. I did marinate the meat a bit longer than suggested, which made it even better. One star off because I wish there were tips for making it less spicy for kids." - Saad.</p>
           
                <p>"This Chicken Curry recipe is a keeper! The gravy was rich and tangy with just the right amount of heat. Served it with roti and my whole family was impressed. Bonus: it came together quickly on a busy weeknight." - Salman V.</p>
